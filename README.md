# 🏋️‍♀️ Beginner Exercises – Calories Burned Analysis

This Tableau project analyzes estimated calorie burn from beginner-level exercises, comparing workouts that **require equipment** to those that **do not**. Using a clean, visual approach, this analysis highlights differences in calorie expenditure and total repetitions across exercise types.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how the presence or absence of equipment affects the **total calories burned** and **total reps performed** in beginner workouts. Using a curated dataset of beginner-friendly exercises, I visualized and compared:

- Equipment-based exercises
- No-equipment exercises
- Total repetitions
- Total estimated calories burned

## 📌 Key Findings

- 🔥 **Total Estimated Calories Burned (No Equipment):**  
  Beginner workouts that require **no equipment** burned a total of **1,673 calories** across all listed exercises.

- 💪 **Total Reps (No Equipment):**  
  These workouts included a total of **351 reps**, indicating higher repetition volume in bodyweight-style movements.

- 🏋️ **Total Estimated Calories Burned (With Equipment):**  
  Workouts that **require equipment** only burned **600 calories** in total.

- 🔄 **Comparison & Insight:**  
  There is a **1,073-calorie increase** in favor of **no-equipment exercises**. This is likely due to the **greater variety and number** of no-equipment beginner exercises in the dataset. This is further supported by a difference of **180 more reps** compared to equipment-based exercises.
